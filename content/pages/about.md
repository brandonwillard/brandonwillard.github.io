I build things with math and computers!

I like to use the language and logic of probability to quantify uncertainty and
frame problems.  You could call me a *statistician*, or a *Bayesian*
[statistician], but, since I don't really deal in the myriad of canned
solutions and acronyms, the title can be problematic.

My interests (personal and professional) tend to revolve around the means
and methods of mathematical modeling and their automation.  I'm a big 
proponent of symbolic computation and its widespread use in research and
industry.

Professionally, I work the whole gamut of design (mathematics, publishable
papers, technical reports) and development (e.g. production level programming
and numerical methods).  My career has covered the areas of finance,
transportation, energy, start-ups and academia, and most often in the research
or planning phases where flexibility and foresight are truly needed.

Here are some situations in which I can be of service:

* When all-purpose modeling libraries like [`statsmodels`](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)
  and [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) are insufficient, or there's no `R` package 
  for the job.
* When a situation calls for more than just the implementation, or
  computational betterment, of existing models.
* When one needs to combine sophisticated models in non-trivial ways.
* When models for high-dimensional, real-time and discrete processes are needed.
* When a model needs automatic model selection beyond
  the basics (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, etc.)
* When a situation demands models that operate with [statistically] principled
  data preprocessing/filtering and orchestration, so that error and uncertainty
  can be assessed broadly.
