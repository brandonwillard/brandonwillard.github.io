I build things with math and computers!

I like to use the language and logic of probability to quantify uncertainty and
frame problems.  You could call me a *statistician* and, more specifically, a
*Bayesian* [statistician].

My interests (personal and professional) tend to revolve around the means
and methods of mathematical modeling and their automation.  I'm a big
proponent of symbolic computation and its widespread use in research and
industry.

Professionally, I work the whole gamut of design (mathematics, publishable
papers, technical reports) and development (e.g. production level programming
and numerical methods).  My career has covered the areas of finance,
transportation, energy, start-ups and academia, and most often in the research
or planning phases where flexibility and foresight are truly needed.

Here are some situations in which I can be of service:

* When available libraries are insufficient in terms of models, design, and/or extensibility.
* When one needs to combine sophisticated models in non-trivial ways.
* High-dimensional, real-time and discrete processes are needed.
* Model selection beyond the basics (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, etc.)
* When a situation demands that data be handled in [statistically] principled ways
