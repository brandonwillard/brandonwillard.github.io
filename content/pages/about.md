I build things with math and computers!

I like to use the language and logic of probability to quantify uncertainty and
frame problems.  You could call me a *statistician* and, more specifically, a
*Bayesian* [statistician].

My interests (personal and professional) revolve around the means
and methods of mathematical modeling and its automation.  I'm a big
proponent of relational programming and symbolic computation, and
I promote their use in research and industry whenever I can.

Professionally, I work the whole gamut of design (e.g. formal mathematics,
publishable papers, technical reports) and development (e.g. numerical methods
research, production-level software projects, large-scale deployments, task
automations, etc.)  My career has covered the areas of finance,
transportation, energy, start-ups, gov-tech, and academia&mdash;often during the
research and planning phases where flexibility and foresight are truly needed.

Here are some situations in which I can be of service:

* When popular statistical modeling or machine learning libraries are inadequate (or unavailable on a given platform).
* When combining or orchestrating sophisticated models in non-trivial ways.
* When dealing with high-dimensional, real-time, and/or discrete processes.
* When model selection is needed for non-standard models.
* When a complex situation demands that data be handled in [statistically] principled ways.

Here's a [live copy of my CV](http://bit.ly/3cNM4nk).

Here are some things I've been involved in:

* [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (as a mentor for PyMC under NumFOCUS)
* [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) (as an inaugural mentor)
* [MTA Bus Time](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Main/Technology)
