#### The Horseshoe+ Estimator of Ultra-Sparse Signals

Authors: Anindya Bhadra, Jyotishka Datta, Nicholas G. Polson and Brandon T. Willard

>  We propose a new prior for ultra-sparse signal detection that we
>  term the "horseshoe+" prior. The horseshoe+ prior is a natural extension of
>  the horseshoe prior which has achieved success in the estimation and
>  detection of sparse signals and has been shown to possess a number of
>  desirable theoretical properties while enjoying computational feasibility in
>  high dimensions.  We build upon these advantages with the horseshoe+ prior.
>  Specifically, we develop asymptotic and distributional properties of the
>  horseshoe+ prior together with Kullback-Leibler (KL) concentration properties
>  for its posterior distribution and prove that the horseshoe+ posterior
>  concentrates at a rate faster than that of horseshoe. We also establish
>  theoretically that the proposed estimator has lower mean-squared error in
>  estimating signals compared to horseshoe and achieves the optimal Bayes risk
>  in testing up to a constant. In simulations, we demonstrate the superior
>  performance of the horseshoe+ estimator in a standard design setting against
>  traditional estimators, including the horseshoe and Dirichlet-Laplace
>  estimators.  For local-global scale mixture priors, we develop a new
>  technique for analysing marginal sparse prior distributions using the class
>  of Meijer-G functions.  Finally, we conclude with an illustration on a
>  prostrate cancer data set and by pointing out some directions for future
>  research.

#### Proximal Algorithms for Statistical Learning

Authors: Nicholas G. Polson, James G. Scott and Brandon T. Willard

> In this paper we develop proximal methods for statistical
> learning. Proximal point algorithms are useful in statistics and
> machine learning for obtaining optimization solutions for composite
> functions. Our approach exploits closed-form solutions of proximal
> operators and envelope representations based on the Moreau,
> Forward-Backward, Douglas-Rachford and Half-Quadratic
> envelopes. Envelope representations lead to novel proximal
> algorithms for statistical optimisation of composite objective
> functions which include both non-smooth and non-convex
> objectives. We illustrate our methodology with regularized Logistic
> and Poisson regression and non-convex bridge penalties with a fused
> lasso norm. We provide a discussion of convergence of non-descent
> algorithms with acceleration and for non-convex functions. Finally,
> we provide directions for future research.

#### Real-time On/Off-Road GPS Tracking  

Authors: Brandon Willard

> This document describes a GPS-based tracking model for position and velocity
> states on and off of a road network and it enables parallel, online learning of
> state-dependent parameters, such as GPS error, acceleration error, and road
> transition probabilities. More specifically, the conditionally linear tracking
> model of Ulmke and Koch (2006) is adapted to the Particle Learning framework of
> H. F. Lopes, et. al. (2011), which provides a foundation for further
> hierarchical Bayesian extensions. The filter is shown to perform well on a real
> city road network while sufficiently estimating on and off road transition
> probabilities. The model in this paper is also backed by an open-source Java
> project.

#### Computation of NRQCD Parameters in Potential Models

Authors: Brandon Willard

> This paper gives details of computing the numerical values of the radial wave
> function at the origin of heavy quark-antiquark system, $$|R\_nl(0)|\^2$$, and
> its derivatives in potential quark models. These quantities provide numerical
> estimates of the non-perturbative parameters in Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD),
> an effective field theory describing decay and production of heavy quarkonium
> states. In particular, we computed wave functions at the origin for three
> different spherically symmetric potentials describing cc, bb and cb bound
> states. The methods used for calculating the radial wave function at the origin
> are covered, along with the code used to produce the values given.  Comparisons
> are made with values obtained by Eichten and Quigg and Quigg and Rosner.

#### Functions Alternative to the Likelihood

Authors: Brandon Willard

> In this paper we determine the need for improved bias sensitive
> methods in particle physics and apply a technique that uses higher
> order derivatives of the likelihood to improve efficiency in a narrow
> resonance \#t scenario. The technique used is that described by G.
> Bonvicini in [1].
