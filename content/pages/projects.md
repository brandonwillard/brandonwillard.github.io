Check [Github](https://github.com/brandonwillard) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/brandonwillard) to see what I've been up to.  Otherwise, here's
a quick roundup...

**MTA Bus Time**  

>    The Bus Time project involves basic tracking (location) and inference on hidden
>    operational states (e.g. trip, route, and "correct" run, sign codes, operator).
>    It uses a conditional Dynamic Linear Model for movement dynamics within a
>    Particle Filter, which estimates the discrete operational states.
>    The results are then used for real-time distance-to-stop estimates.  
>    [site](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Main/Technology)  

**open-tracking-tools**

>    open-tracking-tools is an open-source vehicle tracking library that implements
>    standard and advanced Particle Filter approaches to model on/off-road states.
>    Paths traveled on road segments are inferred and model parameters (e.g.
>    on/off-road probabilities, GPS error) can be estimated real-time.  
>    [github](https://github.com/brandonwillard/open-tracking-tools)

**StatsLibExtensions**

>    Extensions to the Cognitive Foundry API including, but not limited to,
>    specialized distributions, sampling techniques, and numerically stable
>    computations for Dynamic Linear Models.  
>    [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/brandonwillard/statslibextensions)

**ParticleBayes**

>    ParticleBayes is an R package that contains a collection of particle filters
>    for a subset of hierarchical Bayesian models, with a focus on sequentially
>    learning model parameters alongside state variables.  
>    [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/brandonwillard/particlebayes)

**ParticleLearningModels**

>    Java code for Bayesian models that are estimated by Particle Filters and
>    implement parameter learning.  
>    [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/brandonwillard/particlelearningmodels)

**CTA-sim**

>    Big data simulation of Chicago's public transportation to improve
>    transit planning and reduce bus crowding.  
>    [site](http://dssg.io/projects/2013/\#cta) |
>    [github](https://github.com/dssg/cta-sim)

**energywise**

>    An energy analytics tool to make commercial building more energy
>    efficient.  
>    [site](http://dssg.io/projects/2013/\#lbnl) |
>    [github](https://github.com/dssg/energywise)
