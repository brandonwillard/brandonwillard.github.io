  abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy's syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy's syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6\texttimes{} to 7.5\texttimes{} faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the CPU and between 6.5\texttimes{} and 44\texttimes{} faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

  abstract = {BackgroundFast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations.Conclusions/SignificanceViolations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new fixed-interval smoothing algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is presented. The main idea of the new algorithm is to combine a forward-pass SVD-based square-root Kalman filter, developed recently by the authors, with a Rauch-Tung-Striebel backward-pass recursive smoother by using the SVD as a main computational tool. Similarly to the SVD-based square-root filter, the proposed smoother has good numerical stability and does not require covariance matrix inversion. It is formulated in a vector-matrix form, and thus is handy for implementation with parallel computers. A typical numerical example is used to demonstrate the performance of the new smoother},
