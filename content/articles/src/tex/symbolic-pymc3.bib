  title = {Probabilistic {{Inference}} in {{Piecewise Graphical Models}}},
  copyright = {http://legaloffice.weblogs.anu.edu.au/content/copyright/},
  abstract = {In many applications of probabilistic inference the models
    contain piecewise densities that are differentiable except at
    partition boundaries. For instance, (1) some models may
    intrinsically have finite support, being constrained to some
    regions; (2) arbitrary density functions may be approximated by
    mixtures of piecewise functions such as piecewise polynomials or
    piecewise exponentials; (3) distributions derived from other
    distributions (via random variable transformations) may be highly
    piecewise; (4) in applications of Bayesian inference such as
    Bayesian discrete classification and preference learning, the
    likelihood functions may be piecewise; (5) context-specific
    conditional probability density functions (tree-CPDs) are
    intrinsically piecewise; (6) influence diagrams (generalizations
    of Bayesian networks in which along with probabilistic inference,
    decision making problems are modeled) are in many applications
    piecewise; (7) in probabilistic programming, conditional
    statements lead to piecewise models. As we will show, exact
    inference on piecewise models is not often scalable (if
    applicable) and the performance of the existing approximate
    inference techniques on such models is usually quite poor.
    This thesis fills this gap by presenting scalable and accurate
    algorithms for inference in piecewise probabilistic graphical
    models. Our first contribution is to present a variation of Gibbs
    sampling algorithm that achieves an exponential sampling speedup
    on a large class of models (including Bayesian models with
    piecewise likelihood functions). As a second contribution, we
    show that for a large range of models, the time-consuming Gibbs
    sampling computations that are traditionally carried out per
    sample, can be computed symbolically, once and prior to the
    sampling process. Among many potential applications, the
    resulting symbolic Gibbs sampler can be used for fully automated
    reasoning in the presence of deterministic constraints among
    random variables. As a third contribution, we are motivated by
    the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in optics \textemdash{}in particular,
    the reflection and refraction of light on the refractive
    surfaces\textemdash{} to present a new Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method that
    demonstrates a significantly improved performance on piecewise
    models.
    Hopefully, the present work represents a step towards scalable
    and accurate inference in an important class of probabilistic
    models that has largely been overlooked in the literature.},

  abstract = {Proximal algorithms are useful for obtaining solutions to difficult optimization problems, especially those involving nonsmooth or composite objective functions. A proximal algorithm is one whose basic iterations involve the proximal operator of some function, whose evaluation requires solving a specific optimization problem that is typically easier than the original problem. Many familiar algorithms can be cast in this form, and this “proximal view” turns out to provide a set of broad organizing principles for many algorithms useful in statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we show how a number of recent advances in this area can inform modern statistical practice. We focus on several main themes: (1) variable splitting strategies and the augmented Lagrangian; (2) the broad utility of envelope (or variational) representations of objective functions; (3) proximal algorithms for composite objective functions; and (4) the surprisingly large number of functions for which there are closed-form solutions of proximal operators. We illustrate our methodology with regularized Logistic and Poisson regression incorporating a nonconvex bridge penalty and a fused lasso penalty. We also discuss several related issues, including the convergence of nondescent algorithms, acceleration and optimization for nonconvex functions. Finally, we provide directions for future research in this exciting area at the intersection of statistics and optimization.},
